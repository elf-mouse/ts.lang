## Third-party Declaration Files

TypeScript declaration files are usually written by hand, but thereâ€™s a high chance that the library you need already has a `.d.ts`. file created by somebody else. [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/) is the biggest public repository, containing files for over a thousand libraries. There is also a popular Node.js module for managing TypeScript definitions called [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings).

> If you still need to write a declaration file yourself, this [guide](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/writing-declaration-files.html) will get you started.
